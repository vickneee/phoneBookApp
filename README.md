## Note on MongoDB Cluster

>This application is currently using a shared MongoDB cluster for development environments and low-traffic applications. Shared clusters have some limitations and are not recommended for high-traffic applications. They are also not optimized for performance, which can result in slower response times.

>As a result, you may experience a delay when the application is loading data, especially at the beginning. This is expected behavior given the current setup and not a bug in the application.

>For a production application, it is recommended to use a dedicated MongoDB cluster to ensure optimal performance.
